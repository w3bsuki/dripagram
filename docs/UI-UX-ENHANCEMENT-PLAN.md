# UI/UX Enhancement Plan

Date: August 3, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document contains a high-level audit of the current UI/UX and a prioritized action plan to elevate the user experience, visual consistency, and accessibility of the application.

## 2. Current State Audit

### 2.1 UI Assessment

- Inconsistent typography scales and font weights across headers, body copy, and buttons
- Color palette lacks contrast and brand cohesion; many interactive elements are not visually distinct
- Spacing and layout grids are uneven—components feel cramped on mobile and too sparse on desktop
- Button, form, and card styles vary between pages (shadows, borders, radii)

### 2.2 UX Assessment

- Navigation hierarchy is unclear; primary and secondary actions are mixed
- Key flows (onboarding, listing creation, checkout) lack progress indicators and contextual help
- Error states and form validation messages are inconsistent or missing
- Accessibility gaps: missing alt text, low color contrast, non-semantic HTML elements
- Load performance on content-heavy pages degrades the perceived UX

## 3. Recommendations

### 3.1 Establish a Design System

- Define a core component library using Tailwind CSS + Radix UI or Headless UI
- Create tokens for colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows
- Document patterns (buttons, inputs, modals, cards) in a living style guide

### 3.2 Visual Consistency & Branding

- Refine primary and secondary color palette for accessibility (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
- Standardize typography scale: H1–H6, body, captions
- Apply a uniform spacing system (4px or 8px base unit)

### 3.3 Component & Layout Improvements

- Buttons: hover/focus states, disabled styling, size variants
- Forms: grouped inputs, consistent validation UI, real-time feedback
- Cards & Lists: consistent margin, padding, and image aspect ratios
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile (≤640px), tablet (641–1024px), desktop (>1024px)

### 3.4 Navigation & User Flows

- Simplify header navigation; use clear labels and maintain sticky header on scroll
- Introduce breadcrumbs or step indicators on multi-step workflows
- Improve CTA prominence (primary vs. secondary) with clear microcopy

### 3.5 Accessibility & Performance

- Audit and correct HTML semantics (buttons vs. divs, landmark regions)
- Add ARIA roles, labels, and keyboard focus states
- Optimize images (use responsive `<picture>` or Next/Image equivalents)
- Lazy-load non-critical content and reduce bundle sizes (code splitting)

### 3.6 Localization & Content

- Review `messages/en.json` for missing or inconsistent copy
- Integrate inlang plugin to streamline translations and fallback content
- Provide context in copy (e.g., “Why we ask for this detail” blurbs)

## 4. Prioritized Roadmap

| Phase   | Duration | Key Deliverables                                     |
| ------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | 1 week   | Design tokens, color & typography audit, style guide |
| Phase 2 | 2 weeks  | Core component library (buttons, forms, cards)       |
| Phase 3 | 2 weeks  | Update primary flows (onboarding, listing, checkout) |
| Phase 4 | 1 week   | Accessibility audit & fixes                          |
| Phase 5 | 1 week   | Performance optimizations & QA                       |

## 5. Metrics & Validation

- Conversion rate improvement on key flows (≥10%)
- Task completion time reduction (measured via user testing)
- Accessibility score (e.g., Lighthouse accessibility > 90)
- Visual regressions tracked via Chromatic or Storybook

## 6. Next Steps

1. Kick off design workshop with stakeholders
2. Create low-fidelity wireframes and validate with 3–5 target users
3. Build and deploy style guide / component library
4. Incrementally refactor existing pages in alignment with the new system
5. Conduct accessibility and performance audits before each release
