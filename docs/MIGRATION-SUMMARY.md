## Project Status

**Location:** `K:\driplo.bg-main\driplo-fresh\`  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for development  
**Technology:** SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4  
**Database:** Existing Supabase instance (preserved)  
**Package Manager:** pnpm (faster than npm)

## What the New Claude Needs to Do

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review all documentation** in `docs/` folder
2. **Set up environment variables** (copy from original project)
3. **Verify project starts** with `pnpm run dev`
4. **Begin Phase 1** following CLAUDE-PROMPT-GUIDE.md

### Development Approach

- **Build feature-by-feature** following the priority order
- **Use only Svelte 5 syntax** (never Svelte 4)
- **Test thoroughly** before moving to next feature
- **Keep design clean and professional**
- **Focus on production quality**
