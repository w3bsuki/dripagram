- **Three Algorithmic Feeds:**
  - **For You** - Personalized recommendations (needs AI/ML logic)
  - **Newest** - Latest listings by creation date (Supabase sorted)
  - **Trending** - Most liked/engaged items (heart count based)

### 🔥 **Product Discovery** (Currently Built ✅)

## 🎯 **Revenue Streams**

1. **Verified Business Accounts** - 50 BGN/month for brand stories placement
2. **Featured Listings** - Premium placement in "For You" feed
3. **Transaction Fees** - Small % on successful sales (future)
4. **Premium Messaging** - Advanced seller tools (currently free)

## 🧠 **Core Algorithms We Need**

### 1. **"For You" Feed Logic**

```typescript
// Personalization factors:
- User's liked items (categories, brands, price ranges)
- User's browsing history
- Similar users' preferences (collaborative filtering)
- Location-based recommendations
- Time-based patterns (seasonal, trending)
```

**Implementation Options:**

- **Simple**: Weighted scoring based on user interactions
- **Advanced**: ML recommendation engine (TensorFlow.js or external API)
- **Plugin**: Third-party recommendation service

### 2. **"Trending" Algorithm**

```typescript
// Trending score formula:
score = likes * 2 + views * 0.5 + messages * 3 + age_penalty;
// Recent items get boost, older items decay
```

### 3. **Server-Side Like System**

- **Real-time Updates** - Supabase real-time subscriptions
- **Optimistic UI** - Instant feedback, server sync
- **Persistent Storage** - Likes survive app reloads

## 🎨 **Design System Goals**

### Colors & Typography

- **Primary Blue** - Clean, professional (not amateur)
- **Typography** - Modern, readable font hierarchy
- **No Gradients** - Flat, clean Instagram aesthetic
- **Proper Borders** - Subtle, professional boundaries

### UI/UX Improvements Needed

- [ ] Fix verified brands purple border → clean white/blue
- [ ] Improve green "live" dot visibility
- [ ] Standardize button colors and hover states
- [ ] Perfect typography scales and weights
- [ ] Remove any "amateurish" blue text colors

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

- SvelteKit 2.27+ (file-based routing, SSR)
- TypeScript 5.9+ (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-first styling)
- shadcn-svelte (consistent UI components)
```

### Backend Stack (Current ✅)
