# ðŸª£ Supabase Storage Setup for Product Images

## Quick Fix for "Bucket not found" Error

You're getting the bucket error because we need to create the storage bucket first. Here are two ways to fix this:

## Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Fastest)

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** â†’ **Create Bucket**
3. Create a new bucket with these settings:
   - **Bucket name**: `listing-images`
   - **Public**: âœ… **Enabled**
   - **File size limit**: 10 MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif`

4. Go to **Storage** â†’ **Policies** and add these policies:

```sql
-- Users can upload listing images
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload listing images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'listing-images'
    AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Anyone can view listing images
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view listing images" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'listing-images');

-- Users can update own listing images
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own listing images" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    bucket_id = 'listing-images'
    AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );

-- Users can delete own listing images
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own listing images" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE USING (
    bucket_id = 'listing-images'
    AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
    AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
  );
```

## Option 2: Via Migration (Recommended)

If you're using Supabase CLI, run:

```bash
# Apply the migration we just created
supabase db push
```

The migration file `20250805_create_listing_images_bucket.sql` will automatically create the bucket and policies.

## Option 3: Manual SQL (Supabase SQL Editor)

Copy and paste this into your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the listing-images bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('listing-images', 'listing-images', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Configure bucket settings
UPDATE storage.buckets
SET
  file_size_limit = 10485760, -- 10MB limit
  allowed_mime_types = ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/gif']
WHERE id = 'listing-images';

-- Add storage policies (paste the policies from Option 1 above)
```

## âœ… Test the Fix

After creating the bucket:

1. Sign in to your app
2. Go to `/sell`
3. Try uploading an image
4. Should work without the "Bucket not found" error!

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Happened

I implemented the image upload service before creating the storage infrastructure. In production, you'd typically:

1. Set up database schema âœ… (we did this)
2. Set up storage buckets âœ… (we missed this)
3. Build the frontend features âœ… (we did this)

The bucket creation should have been in our initial setup. Sorry for the oversight!
